Relax with the sounds of nature!  Play and Mix Ambient sounds to boost concentration and productivity.

Chill n' Sound is written entirely in Vanilla JS, it is a clone of websites like Noisli or A soft murmur. 
You are free to fork or clone the project and create something with it. If you do make something let me know! I would like to check it out.
