Relax with the sounds of nature!  Play and Mix Ambient sounds to boost concentration and productivity.

Chill n' Sound is written entirely in Vanilla JS, it is a clone of websites like Noisli or A soft murmur. 
You are free to fork or clone the project and create something with it. If you do make something let me know! I would like to check it out.

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amilajack/chillnsound
cd chillnsound
yarn
yarn start
# Build
yarn build

```

## Chrome Extension

You can checkout Chrome Extension for Chill N Sound <a href="https://github.com/petrovicstefanrs/chillnsound_chrome_extension" target="_blank">here</a>.
  - Chrome Extension is still in beta and will probably stay that way some time as I can't find the time to work on it anymore, but you are more than welcome to contribute to the project!
